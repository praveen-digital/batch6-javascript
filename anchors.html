			In the preceding chapter, you used a keyword to set the value of the cursor property. Many CSS properties use
			predefined keywords, but sizes, colors, and the location of files need to be specified individually. This chapter
			describes the units of measurement and the syntax used to specify colors and files. CSS3 introduces several new
			units of measurement, which are only gradually being implemented by browsers, so you need to use them with
			caution.
			In this chapter you’ll learn about the following:
			•	 Which units of measurement to use for visual browsers and printers
			•	 Understanding the difference between physical pixels and CSS pixels
			•	 Specifying colors by name
			•	 Which color formats are supported in CSS
			•	 Setting color transparency
			•	 Specifying the location of files, such as background images
			This chapter contains a lot of dry, factual information; but it’s essential reading for working with CSS.

			The CSS specifications use the term length to refer to vertical and horizontal measurements. The CSS3 Values
			and Units module introduces several new units of measurement, as well as a function that allows the browser to
			calculate a length value. These new features are not supported by all browsers, so I’ll describe them separately to
			avoid confusion.The CSS specifications use the term length to refer to vertical and horizontal measurements. The CSS3 Values

			Although no unit is required after zero, browsers are likely to interpret the px in the final example as garbage
			and ignore the style definition.
			An em is a unit of measurement borrowed from typography. The name originates from the width of the letter
			M; but in CSS it means the height of the current font, usually including whitespace above and below. So, with a
			16-pixel font, one em equals 16 pixels; with a 24-pixel font, it’s 24 pixels, and so on. Specifying the width or height
			of an element in ems adjusts its size in proportion to the size of the font.
